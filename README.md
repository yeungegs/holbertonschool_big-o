## Project Details

### Synopsis
This project introduces concepts of data structures and algorithms in programming. It is meant to be done by groups of two students. Each group of two should pair program for at least the mandatory part.

### What students should learn from this project
At the end of this project you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:
- At least four different sorting algorithms
- What is the Big O notation, and how to evaluate the time complexity of an algorithm
- How to select the best sorting algorithm for a given input
- What is a stable sorting algorithm

### Resources
- [Exercises](https://github.com/yeungegs/kochan-c-exercises/tree/master/chapter-11) from Chapter 11 - "Operations on Bits" from [Stephen Kochan's  book "Programming in C"](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=kochan+programming+in+c&*) pages 278 - 285 
- WikiHow article for [how to convert from binary to decimal](http://www.wikihow.com/Convert-from-Binary-to-Decimal)

### Project Requirements
- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
- Your programs and functions will be compiled with `gcc 4.8.4` (`C90`) using the flags `-Wall -Werror -Wextra and -pedantic`

- All your files should end with a new line
- A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory
- Your code should use the `Betty` style. It will be checked using [`betty-style.pl`](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/blob/master/betty-style.pl) and [`betty-doc.pl`](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/blob/master/betty-doc.pl)
- You are not allowed to use global variables
- No more than 5 functions per file
- The only C standard library functions allowed are `malloc`, `free` and `exit`. Any use of functions like `printf`, `puts`, `calloc`, `realloc` etc... is forbidden
- You are allowed to use [`_putchar`](https://github.com/holbertonschool/_putchar.c/blob/master/_putchar.c)
- You don't have to push `_putchar.c`, we will use our file. If you do it won't be taken into account
- The prototypes of all your functions and the prototype of the function `_putchar` should be included in your header file called [`holberton.h`](./holberton.h)
- Don't forget to push your header file
- All your header files should be include guarded
